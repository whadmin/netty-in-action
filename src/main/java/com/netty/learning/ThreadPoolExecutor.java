/**
 * 线程池实现类
 *
 * 线程池好比一个工厂，作为一个工厂几大要素必不可少 "订单"，"员工"，同时还需要管理机制以应对市场的需求。
 * 线程池中 “订单” 对应的是Runnable,而“员工” 对应的是Worker
 *
 * 线程池和工厂一样采用生产消费者模型，
 *
 * 线程池会对新提交的Runnable先会添加一个workQueue中，
 * Worker会从workQueue取出Runnable去执行
 *
 * 创建线程池和创建一个工厂差不多，不过这个工厂为了最大限度控制成本，创建出一个员工没有，只有接收订单才去雇佣员工处理订单
 *
 * 线程池和工厂一样需要由管理策略
 *
 * 工厂为了维持管理自身的成本，会雇佣一定数量正式员工为工厂服务，在线程池中表示为CorePoolSize，遇到订单高峰期也会雇佣一些临时员工来处理，而高峰过了就会辞退长期空闲的临时员工
 *
 * 当获取新任务时：
 *
 * 发现员工数量少于CorePoolSize（正式员工离职），工厂会雇佣一个正式员工来完成新任务
 *
 * 发现员工数量大于CorePoolSize，将任务加入工作队列，
 *
 * 发现员工数量大于CorePoolSize，工作队列装不下了，雇佣新临时员工将任务直接分配给临时员工，
 *
 *

     * 1. We may start out with an initial task, in which case we
     * don't need to get the first one. Otherwise, as long as pool is
     * running, we get tasks from getTask. If it returns null then the
     * worker exits due to changed pool state or configuration
     * parameters.  Other exits result from exception throws in
     * external code, in which case completedAbruptly holds, which
     * usually leads processWorkerExit to replace this thread.
     *
     * 2. Before running any task, the lock is acquired to prevent
     * other pool interrupts while the task is executing, and then we
     * ensure that unless pool is stopping, this thread does not have
     * its interrupt set.
     *
     * 3. Each task run is preceded by a call to beforeExecute, which
     * might throw an exception, in which case we cause thread to die
     * (breaking loop with completedAbruptly true) without processing
     * the task.
     *
     * 4. Assuming beforeExecute completes normally, we run the task,
     * gathering any of its thrown exceptions to send to afterExecute.
     * We separately handle RuntimeException, Error (both of which the
     * specs guarantee that we trap) and arbitrary Throwables.
     * Because we cannot rethrow Throwables within Runnable.run, we
     * wrap them within Errors on the way out (to the thread's
     * UncaughtExceptionHandler).  Any thrown exception also
     * conservatively causes thread to die.
     *
     * 5. After task.run completes, we call afterExecute, which may
     * also throw an exception, which will also cause thread to
     * die. According to JLS Sec 14.20, this exception is the one that
     * will be in effect even if task.run throws.
     *
     * The net effect of the exception mechanics is that afterExecute
     * and the thread's UncaughtExceptionHandler have as accurate
     * information as we can provide about any problems encountered by
     * user code.
